# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Task 3: Front-End Framework Basics

This project focuses on learning the foundational concepts of modern front-end frameworks by building a simple application. We'll be using **React.js to create a functional To-Do List. This application will demonstrate core framework features by allowing users to add, edit, and delete tasks.

## Project Overview

The goal of this task is to gain hands-on experience with a popular front-end framework and understand how to build interactive user interfaces. The To-Do List application will serve as a practical example to showcase:

*   **Component-Based Architecture:**  Breaking down the UI into reusable components.
*   **State Management:**  Managing the application's data (the list of tasks) and how changes to the state update the UI.
*   **User Interaction Handling:**  Responding to user actions like button clicks and input changes.
*   **Conditional Rendering:**  Displaying UI elements based on the application's state.

## Skills Developed

Upon completing this task, you will have a solid understanding of:

*   **Front-End Framework Basics:**  Core principles and patterns of frameworks like React.js or Angular.
*   **Component Lifecycle (if applicable to chosen framework):**  Understanding how components are created, updated, and destroyed.
*   **Event Handling:**  Capturing and processing user events.
*   **Data Binding:**  Connecting UI elements to application data.

## Getting Started

*(This section is a placeholder. Please fill it in with specific instructions for setting up and running your project.)*

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
*   A code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).
*   *(If using React)*: Knowledge of basic JavaScript and HTML.


### Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd task3-frontend-framework-basics
    ```
2.  Install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
    This will typically open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (for Create React App) or a similar port for other setups.

## Application Features

The To-Do List application allows you to:

*   **Add New Tasks:**  Type a task description into an input field and click "Add" (or press Enter) to add it to the list.
*   **Edit Existing Tasks:**  Click an "Edit" button next to a task to modify its description.
*   **Delete Tasks:**  Click a "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
*   **Mark Tasks as Complete (Optional):**  *(If you've implemented this feature)* Click on a task to toggle its completion status, visually indicating it's done.

## How to Use

1.  After starting the application, you will see an input field and an "Add Task" button (or similar).
2.  Enter the description for your task and click "Add".
3.  Your task will appear in the list below.
4.  To edit a task, click the "Edit" button next to it, modify the text, and save your changes.
5.  To remove a task, click the "Delete" button next to it.
