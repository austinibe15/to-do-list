# Task 3: Front-End Framework Basics

This project focuses on learning the foundational concepts of modern front-end frameworks by building a simple application. We'll be using **React.js to create a functional To-Do List. This application will demonstrate core framework features by allowing users to add, edit, and delete tasks.

## Project Overview

The goal of this task is to gain hands-on experience with a popular front-end framework and understand how to build interactive user interfaces. The To-Do List application will serve as a practical example to showcase:

*   **Component-Based Architecture:**  Breaking down the UI into reusable components.
*   **State Management:**  Managing the application's data (the list of tasks) and how changes to the state update the UI.
*   **User Interaction Handling:**  Responding to user actions like button clicks and input changes.
*   **Conditional Rendering:**  Displaying UI elements based on the application's state.

## Skills Developed

Upon completing this task, you will have a solid understanding of:

*   **Front-End Framework Basics:**  Core principles and patterns of frameworks like React.js or Angular.
*   **Component Lifecycle (if applicable to chosen framework):**  Understanding how components are created, updated, and destroyed.
*   **Event Handling:**  Capturing and processing user events.
*   **Data Binding:**  Connecting UI elements to application data.

## Getting Started

*(This section is a placeholder. Please fill it in with specific instructions for setting up and running your project.)*

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
*   A code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).
*   *(If using React)*: Knowledge of basic JavaScript and HTML.


### Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd task3-frontend-framework-basics
    ```
2.  Install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
    This will typically open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (for Create React App) or a similar port for other setups.

## Application Features

The To-Do List application allows you to:

*   **Add New Tasks:**  Type a task description into an input field and click "Add" (or press Enter) to add it to the list.
*   **Edit Existing Tasks:**  Click an "Edit" button next to a task to modify its description.
*   **Delete Tasks:**  Click a "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
*   **Mark Tasks as Complete (Optional):**  *(If you've implemented this feature)* Click on a task to toggle its completion status, visually indicating it's done.

## How to Use

1.  After starting the application, you will see an input field and an "Add Task" button (or similar).
2.  Enter the description for your task and click "Add".
3.  Your task will appear in the list below.
4.  To edit a task, click the "Edit" button next to it, modify the text, and save your changes.
5.  To remove a task, click the "Delete" button next to it.
